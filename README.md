# It's-a me, Dominic üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I am a recent career changer. I was a Los Angeles-based filmmaker and photographer with my last full-time job being Assistant Editor for a [ViacomCBS ad agency](https://www.whosay.com) where I supervised post production on ad campaigns for brands such as Google Pixel, McDonalds, Folgers, Target, Pampers, and many more.

I decided to pivot because I have always followed and loved the landscape of technology and would like to contribute to its future. Because I wanted to jump in sooner than later, I attended the [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com) coding bootcamp after some months of self-teaching to fast charge my education.
