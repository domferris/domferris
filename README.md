# It's-a me, Dominic üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I am a recent career changer. I was a Los Angeles-based filmmaker and photographer with my last full-time job being Assistant Editor for a [ViacomCBS ad agency](https://www.whosay.com) where I supervised post production on ad campaigns for brands such as Google Pixel, McDonalds, Folgers, Target, Pampers, and many more. I decided to pivot because I have always followed and loved the landscape of technology and would like to contribute to its future. Because I wanted to jump in sooner than later, I attended the [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com) coding bootcamp after some months of self-teaching to fast charge my education.

## Technologies

[Le Wagon's curriculum](https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course/full-time#curriculum) helped me grasp the core concepts of programming through Ruby. After studying the fundamentals, I learned how to create smaller-scale products using Ruby on Rails via Heroku.

I have since taught myself JavaScript. I am currently learning [React on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) and studying [the basics of CS on edX](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0). My first gig in the industry utilized Jekyll, Ruby on Rails, Liquid, Stimulus.js, and PostgreSQL, though I worked primarily with Jekyll and Liquid. This sparked my interest in the Jamstack architechture of web development and [I am currently building my new website](https://github.com/domferris/profile2) with Eleventy, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine.js.

## Work

I recently ended a contract with [Page Bird](https://www.page-bird.com) where I directly communicated with 26 of their clients, maintaining and updating their websites via Netlify. I am volunteering on [a nonprofit](https://spicygreenbook.org) application that is built with React Native and Next.js via Expo. Because my knowledge is limited in that space, I contribute where I can while actively learning the technologies.

I am open for hire. Though I have an idea where I want to go in the industry as far as fields I would like to support with my skills, I am a new developer and I'm open to any opportunities where I can continue to learn and grow.
